For immediate and informal chats, email or even just a shared group text on apps might suffice. Tools like Google's Drive are usually enough for file sharing, cutting down on software investments. Video calls should only include when needed, maintaining focus. Apps are often overrated; efficiency comes from personal preference and comfort zones. Over-engineering communication tools can be, well, just a bit of it.",19,-5.0,60
