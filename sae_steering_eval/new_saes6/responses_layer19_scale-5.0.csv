Emails, and sometimes even just phone calls, can be the most effective and maintain security efficiently. Software-specific needs can often be underestimated. Personalized needs should always lead, and overuse of tech solutions can lead to the opposite of productivity. Keep it simple, stick to the basics!",19,-5.0,60
